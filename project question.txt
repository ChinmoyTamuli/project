Q] we are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to 
    guess it.
   
   If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays "lower number 
   please". Similarly if tyhe user's guess is too low, the program prints"higher number please".
   when the user guesses the correct number, the program display the number of gusses the palyer 
   used to arrive at the number.
